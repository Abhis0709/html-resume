<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> I am an computer science graduate student from SGBAU university before that i had an one year  gap in my education the reason behind it is my family problems my father is not in this world he died in 2015 i am 16 yr old when he died so after my father death everything is on mother, we came from a lower middle class family so its not possible to pay the fee's for my admission so i had to take a gap of  1 year to settle down things.
</p>
<p>The gap i have taken is between my HSC and Graduation. after completing my  graduation i decided to learn web development its bcoz my intrest is in it and second thing is i want to help my family financialy so i thought web development is better option for me to make my carrier</p>
